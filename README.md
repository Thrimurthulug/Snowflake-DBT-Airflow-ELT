Overview
========

Project Name: Snowflake-DBT-Airflow-ELT


Description
================

This project leverages the power of `Snowflake`, `DBT (Data Build Tool)`, and `Airflow` to create a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for efficient data processing and analysis.

Workflow
===========================

1. Data Transformation with DBT: DBT performs transformations on the raw data to create structured, analyzable datasets. SQL-based transformations defined in DBT models are executed within Snowflake, leveraging its computational capabilities.

2. Data Loading: Transformed data is loaded into Snowflake tables optimized for analytical queries, enabling fast and efficient data retrieval.

3. Orchestration with Airflow: Airflow schedules and executes the ETL workflow, orchestrating the sequence of tasks from data extraction to loading. With the integration of Cosmos, Airflow manages the execution of DBT jobs as tasks, ensuring seamless coordination between data transformation and workflow orchestration. Airflow monitors task execution, handles dependencies, and retries failed tasks to ensure data integrity and pipeline reliability.
